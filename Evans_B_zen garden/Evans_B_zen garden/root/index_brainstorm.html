CSS Zen Garden Brainstorming

The theme for my page will be travel. 
My design will attempt to create a curious and creative atmosphere. This will be done with faded background photos of travel destinations such as mountrains or small european towns. The layered look of the content is used to mimic scattered travel paperwork (passports, maps, train tickets, etc). The colours I use will be colours you may see when travelling. I will use a colour that resembles plaster, coral, the ocean and the sky. The typefaces I use will resemble handwriting but will remain legible for the readers. The reason for this is to imitate the idea of a journal. Many people keep journals while they travel and this will hopefully help to set the mood of the page. 

Back up ideas

1. A Bakery themed page using nice browns, yellows, oranges and maybe off whites to set the atmosphere of the page. 

2. A wedding planning themed page using black, whites, greys and blues. The page would be very crisp and neat to convince the readers of the companies organizational skills. Cursive writing would be used for the titles to add an elegance to the page.
